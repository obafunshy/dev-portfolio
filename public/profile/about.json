    "about": "\n\n\n With over 5 years of experience as a Software Engineer, and now delving into the Cloud computing engineering space with my knowledge, I am qualified to be a DevOps Engineer. \n\nAlthough my primary language is PHP which enabled me to work on major PHP frameworks, ranging from Laravel, to WordPress, Magento, and so on, Frontend is VueJS, but I can also work with ReactJs very well. I have been part of the Agile Enabled development team over the years, which gave me the experience to collaborate on versioning platforms like Gitlab, containers like Docker, Project side of things like Jira. On the cloud side of things, I am skilled in AWS, Kubernetes, and Terraform. And I have good knowledge of the networking side of things and protocols. \n\nAltogether, I am great at working alone, as part of a team, or as head of the team. We are all solution providers connected in one way or another to make the world a better place.",
